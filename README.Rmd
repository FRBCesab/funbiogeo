## Overview

The package `funbiogeo` aims to help users with analyses in functional biogeography 
(Violle et al. 2014) by loading and combining data, computing trait coverage, 
as well as computing functional diversity indices, drawing maps, correlating 
them with the environment, and upscaling assemblages.

To know what features are planned in the future you can refer to our 
[Roadmap wiki page](https://github.com/FRBCesab/funbiogeo/wiki/Roadmap).


## Installation

For the moment `funbiogeo` is not on CRAN but you can install the development 
version from GitHub as follow:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")  # Run this line if 'remotes' pkg is not installed
remotes::install_github("FRBCesab/funbiogeo")
```


## Getting started

Please refer to the ["Getting started" vignette](https://frbcesab.github.io/funbiogeo/).


## Related packages

To understand better our working philosophy you can refer to our 
[Design principles wiki page](https://github.com/FRBCesab/funbiogeo/wiki/Design-Principles).

`funbiogeo` relies on other packages to provide critical features:

* [`fundiversity`](https://github.com/Bisaloo/fundiversity) computes functional diversity indices.
* [`funrar`](https://github.com/Rekyt/funrar) computes functional originality indices.
* [`mFD`](https://github.com/CmlMagneville/mFD) computes functional diversity indices.
