\usage{
fb_count_sites_by_species(site_species)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_species}{a \code{data.frame} with sites in rows and species in columns.
\strong{NOTE}: the first column should be named \strong{\code{"site"}} and indicate site
names. The other columns should be named according to species names.}
}
\value{
